# Expansion tests

Similar to ui tests, but instead of checking the compiler output, this checks the code generated by macros.

To run this test, run the following command:

```sh
MACROTEST=overwrite cargo test -p expandtest
```

Or if you want to run all the tests that include this test:

```sh
bash scripts/ci.sh
```

See [examples](../../examples/README.md) for descriptions of what the generated code does, and why it needs to be generated.
